2. Difference between var, const, let
      VAR: By using const we can assign a variable. 
                It can be updated and re- declared within a scope.
                 It is a function scope
    Const: It is a block scope.
                It is similar to that of let, the only difference is you cannot reassign it to a new value.
                It cannot be updated and re- declared.
        let: It can be defined within curly brackets{ }.
               The variables declared with let can be reassigned.
                It is also a block scope.
